# ServiceTemplate

A foundational template for creating Linux system services managed by systemd, implemented in C.

## Overview

ServiceTemplate provides a structured starting point for developers aiming to implement Linux system services using systemd. By offering a pre-configured setup, it streamlines the development process, allowing you to focus on the core functionality of your service.

## Features

- **Modular C Codebase**: Clean and maintainable code structure to facilitate easy modifications and extensions.
- **Systemd Integration**: Includes a sample service unit file for seamless integration with systemd.
- **Makefile Automation**: Simplifies the build process with predefined targets.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed instructions to guide you through setup and customization.

## Prerequisites

Ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System**: Any recent Linux supporting systemd
- **Compiler**: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).
- **Build Tool**: Make

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the service:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pdepuydt/ServiceTemplate.git
   cd ServiceTemplate
   ```
2. **Build the Service**:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
3. **Install the Service**:
   ```bash
   sudo make install
   ```
4. **Enable and Start the Service**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable servicetemplate
   sudo systemctl start servicetemplate
   ```

## Usage

Once installed, the service will run in the background. You can interact with it using standard systemd commands:

- **Check Status**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status servicetemplate
  ```
- **Stop the Service**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl stop servicetemplate
  ```
- **Restart the Service**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart servicetemplate
  ```

## Customization

To tailor the service to your needs:

- **Modify the Source Code**: Edit the C files in the `src` directory using JOE.
- **Update the Service Unit File**: Adjust `servicetemplate.service` in `/etc/systemd/system/` to change service parameters.
- **Rebuild the Service**: After making changes, run `make` and `sudo make install` to apply updates.
